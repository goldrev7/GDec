**This file  is an example of what can be done with the GDec algorithm.**


It is an utility for the Skyblock minigame of the Hypixel minecraft server.
It decomposes the recipe of a forgeable item into its first non-forgeable components.


_For example, a mithril plate will be decomposed into 160 pieces of enchanted mithril._

Items are referred to by their skyblock ID :
The golden plate will be : GOLDEN_PLATE
The only exceptions are pets, who all have the "PET" ID. I simply added their name after !
For example, the penguin is : PET_PENGUIN

_To view the IDs, you can press F3+H in minecraft_
